Module: duocolumn
Version: 1.0.0
Description: Duo Column Dashboard
 This module provides an alternative dashboard layout where dashlets are
 displayed in two columns (side by side) instead of the default responsive
 multi-column grid layout. Each column takes exactly 50% of the available
 width, providing a consistent two-column layout on all screen sizes.
